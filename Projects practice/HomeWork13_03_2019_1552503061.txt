1. Add/integrate the log4net system to a new solution/project
2. Separate logging of INFOs and ERRORs in separated files
3. Develop the ConfigManager class(based on the IConfigManager interface), that incapsulates ConfigurationManager.AppSettings functionality
Example for point 3:
 I want to call "ConfigManager.GetKeyName" instead of call of ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["KeyName"]
